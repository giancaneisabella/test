Of the war you've come to wage against my sins
I'm not okay
But I can try my best to just pretend
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
(I have to let you go)
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you
I know the pain
That you hide behind the smile on your face
And not a day
Goes by where I don't think I feel the same
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you
We'll try again
When we're not so different
We will make amends
'Til then I'll just pretend
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta

Sunflower
My eyes, want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers
Sometimes
Keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Wondering headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste
Before I got to know you
I've got your face
Hung up high in the gallery
I love this shade
(Sunflower, sunflower)
Your flowers just died
Plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dance hall
I couldn't want you any more tonight
Sunflower
My eyes, want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers just died
Keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied

Everybody gonna wanna stand in line
Under Paris pyramids at night
With their pens and papers and prying eyes
Never knowing that I sacrificed
Looking up to the next go cracks
Sistine Chapel and they grace so bad
They could take a million photographs
But a holy love, they'll never have
I live for your touch, I live to inspire
So carve me to pieces, do it in style
Paint me like one of your French girls in emeralds and curls
I give myself over to you
I wanna be remembered, be yours forever
Make me your whole world, your muse
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh (everything I do)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh (I do it for you)
Dirty pictures on the road
Got you on that next flight home
Arch my back like the Triomphe
And cover me in liquid gold
I live for your touch, I live to inspire
So carve me to pieces, do it in style
Paint me like one of your French girls, in emeralds and curls

This is the moment of just letting go
She said, "If you had life eternal"
Can you hear me say your name forever?
Can you see me longing for you forever, forever?
Would you let me touch your soul forever?
Can you feel me longing for you forever, forever?
We dance once more
I feel your hands are cold
Within your heart, a story to be told
This is the moment of just letting go
This is the moment of just letting go
Can you hear me say your name forever?
Can you see me longing for you forever, forever?
Would you let me touch your soul forever?
Can you feel me longing for you forever and ever?
forever
(Forever) forever, (forever) forever, (forever) forever
(Forever) forever, (forever) forever, (forever) forever
(Forever) forever, (forever) forever, (forever) forever
forever
(Forever) forever, (forever) forever, (forever) forever
If you had life eternal?`

            lyrics: `Reach a star, travel far
And find out who you really are
Climb a hill, learn a skill
All of your dreams you can fulfill
Take a dream, make it real
Don't let yourself give in to fear
Come with me
You can make it anywhere
Sing along to this song
And let it show that you're strong
Don't pretend, help a friend
They are with you until the end
You will see, you can be
Whatever you would like to be
Come with me
You can make it anywhere
Fantasy
I want to meet you there
You will see
Fantasy can become reality
Come with me
This is my fantasy
I believe
Fantasy can become reality
Can you be my fantasy?
Take your time, it's not a crime
'Cause life is always in it's prime
Show you care, if you dare
Because true friendship's really rare
Take a dream, make it real
Don't let yourself give in to fear
Come with me
You can make it anywhere
Fantasy
I want to meet you there
You will see
Fantasy can become reality
Come with me
This is my fantasy
I believe
Fantasy can become reality
Fantasy
I want to meet you there
You will see
Fantasy can become reality
Come with me
This is my fantasy
I believe
Fantasy can become reality
Can you be...
(My fantasy)
Oh, you will see
(Can you be...)
Become reality`

Baby, I'm yours
And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky,
Yours until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the sun no longer shines,
Yours (yours) until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time

I'm gonna stay right here by your side,
Do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothin' in the world can drive me away
Cause every day, you'll hear me say

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until two and two is three,
Yours (yours) until the mountain crumbles to the sea
In other words, until eternity

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours`

            lyrics: `I didn't see it coming
But I never really had much faith
In the universe's magic, oh no
Till it pulled us to that time and place, and I'll never forget
When the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
It still has me choking, it's hard to explain
I know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain
So don't say you love me; fala: "Amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me; fala: "Amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
And yeah, I could be punching
But I always tend to fluctuate
And I feel sick that I'm buzzing; oh, love, I'm in trouble
I'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place, and I don't wanna get wet
But I think we're chosen like our fates were woven
And all of those bad choices were left turns on the way
So don't say you love me; fala: "Amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me; fala: "Amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
I think best way to explain, it's like
Yeah, kinda like that, but little more
Yeah, all makes sense right like, like, like
So don't say you love me; fala: "Amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me; fala: "Amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me; fala: "Amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
